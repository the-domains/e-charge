# MORE POWER. MORE TORQUE.  
MAX ADVENTURE.

The Zero DSR is an amped-up version of the Zero DS, bringing unprecedented levels of power and torque to the world's most versatile electric motorcycle. For the dual sport rider demanding more, the Zero DSR delivers 56% more torque and 25% more power. A 660 amp controller is paired with a Z-Force(r) motor that contains higher temperature magnets to ensure better performance during extended durations at higher speeds. The result is exhilarating acceleration and even greater prowess off-road.

With a 0-60 mph time of 3.9 seconds and 106 ft-lb of torque on demand, the Zero DSR may be civilized but is by no means subdued. With custom-tuned Showa suspension and Bosch ABS, it is equally at home on pavement and dirt. The Zero DSR is more than ready for maximum adventure...whether it's in the city or places beyond.
